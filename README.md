## Project Overview
This project analyses the Game App, Productivity App and Utility App data for a company called for 2024 showing the total Revenue, profit, and cash and showing if it's under budget or above budget. Also shows the % change to present value and % change to budget for revenue, profit and cash. A comparision of the Actual profit to budget was carried out filtering between top 6 and bottom 6. We seek to have a better understanding of the company performance for this period and identify trend in data over this period of time.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the Overall Revenue trend?
- What is the Overall Profit trend?
- What is the Total Customer Trend?
- What is the Total Sales/Target Sales relationship?
- Customer and Sales per region.

## Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The Company sales experience an increase and later a drop at the close of the period
2. The month of May generated the highest sale, while January generated the lowest sales
3. Columbia has the highest customers, while Brazil has the least customers
4. Chicago is the region with the highest sales generated.
5. There was increase in customer for each month and september recorded the highest customer. 

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:

## Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from sales and customers column because they would affect the accuracy of my conclusion from the analysis.
